# Drug_Discover_Portifolio_projects
This is a small drug discovery bioinformatics project. We are searching for molecules that could be taken orally by a human to treat CoV-SARS.
In this Jupyter notebook, we are building a real-life data science project that can be used in our data science portfolio. Particularly, we will be building a machine learning model using the ChEMBL bioactivity data.
 
 **ChEMBL Database**
The ChEMBL Database is a database that contains curated bioactivity data of more than 2 million compounds. It is compiled from more than 76,000 documents, 1.2 million assays and the data spans 13,000 targets and 1,800 cells and 33,000 indications.
[Data as of May 18, 2020; ChEMBL version 27].
